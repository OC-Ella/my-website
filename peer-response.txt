Suggestion 1) Hunter Balsz - "...I love the dark background colors as it's easier on my eyes but the 
              gray background with the magenta/purple color messes with my eyes when trying to read."

Fixed By: To fix this issue, I made the gray background a bit darker and the magenta font color a bit
          lighter. This way, the text is much easier to read and user-friendly. Additionally, I did 
          this on every single CSS document, wherever these colors were located.

Suggestion 2) Hunter Balsz - "Another thing that I wouldn't mind to see is a scenic background on there
              instead of a blue background on all 4 pages."

Fixed By: To fix this issue, I added an scenic background on my "Extra Cats" webpage, consisting of clouds.

Suggestion 3) Sammuel Henninger - "...I want to see more pictures of the cats."

Fixed By: To fix this issue, I added more cat pictures! More specifically, I made my final webpage, "Extra Cats," 
          contain some images of new cats that I have met.
